Given two story inputs and the total number of chapters in the story, the output will infer two sentences. The first sentence determines the narrative intent between the previous and next story segments in an abstract manner. The second sentence briefly explains which part of the three-act structure (beginning, middle, end) this point corresponds to and what role it plays in the progression of the story. By referencing the chapter number in the context of the total chapters in the book, the intent extraction can be more accurately contextualized. The result will be in the simple format: "Story about ~~. In the ~~ part of the three-act structure, playing the role of ~~."
